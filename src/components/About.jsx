            I love creating things that live on the internet, Working remotely and with a touch of style I embrace logical thinking in a broad spectrum.
            I love swimming and hoping to be a deep sea diver. <br /> During the weekends I find myself exploring nature, beach-side chills,checking new destinations and trying recipes.
            I have grown to love playing video games online as a kid. 
            I grew a gist into programming in 2021 as I wanted to do cybersecurity luckily fast-forward after some mentorship and pathway guidance I have grown as a software engineer.
